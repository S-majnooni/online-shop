This project is a school web design project, and it is incomplete in terms of responsiveness,
and it is displayed correctly on the Edge browser and on the desktop, and small parts of this project have not yet been completed,
and minor defects such as optimal display and There are beautiful notifications and the absence of some buttons for the convenience of the user,
as well as the absence of a captcha during user login, the absence of an algorithm for searching products and categories,
and the absence of beautiful animations to interact with the user.
All of these will be resolved over time.
Thanks for reading this text about this project.
